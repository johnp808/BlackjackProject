## Problems // Solutions ##

 * ran into problems where it was printing the hash code
 so i had to figure out which . to use to connect the classes together to print out my desired result.

 * figuring out how to deal cards to the dealer as well as the player. I ended up instantiating a new player and dealer object.

 * had issues figuring out how to and when to restart the game. Ended up using a boolean but I still had some issues with this.
